# Tasks for this project
- [x] Complete part 1 in personal week 3 repository ( @cnguyen1209 )
- [x] Complete part 1 in personal week 3 repository ( @SteelMatrix )

- [ ] Implement Complex Number class
  - Implement the following functions:
    1. Comparison (Divided Work)
        - [x] == ( @SteelMatrix )
        - [x] == r ( @cnguyen1209 )
        - [x] != 2 vector ( @cnguyen1209 )
        - [x] != vector and r ( @cnguyen1209 )
    2. Arithmetic ( @SteelMatrix )
        - [x] Add
        - [x] Subtract
        - [x] Multiply
        - [x] Divide
    3. Assignment ( @cnguyen1209 )
        - [x] =
        - [x] +=
        - [x] -=
        - [x] *=
        - [x] /=
- [ ] Test values (Divided Work)
  - [ ] Calculate the arithmetic answers and place them in the file for testing
  - [ ] Create an assess function for each case, and verify that each case passes
